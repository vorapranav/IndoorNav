# IndoorNavigationAugmentedReality
Most of us find it very difficult to find Meeting rooms or other places like Cafeteria, individual person or Washroom, in our organisation or when we move to different office location. We were new to that location and we have no clue, where is X meeting room or Where is an Emergency exit.


Our navigation(GPS) does not work inside a building or it has very poor accuracy, so we could not navigate using our GPS. There are some ways we can navigate inside a building by setting up Beacons or setting up wifi using HeatMap, But those have either an overhead cost to the Company or it is not reliable for some devices. iOS does not expose its wifi information so we can not use WIFI.


So to tackle this problem I came up with the idea of creating an App using APPLE ARKIT which is an Augmented Reality framework for iOS, I have created a POC where the idea is to scan the whole space, and then making a Map out of it and after using some complex algorithm and mathematics, We can just navigate to anywhere we want.

 

If someone has a meeting and he does not know the location of the meeting room, he can use this app and navigate to the meeting room very easily. If his manager wanted to meet him, his manager can share his location if he is not at his desk and using that shared location someone can navigate to him. There are many other applications to this idea which is under development. We can add revenue to it by adding the location of the third party and showing their ads. Thank You.
